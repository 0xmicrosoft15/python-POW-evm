Methods now raise :class:`~eth.exceptions.BlockNotFound` when retrieving a block, and some part
of the block is missing. These methods used to raise a KeyError if transactions were missing, or a
``HeaderNotFound`` if uncles were missing:

  - :meth:`eth.db.chain.ChainDB.get_block_by_header`
  - :meth:`eth.db.chain.ChainDB.get_block_by_hash` (it still raises a HeaderNotFound if there is no
    header matching the given hash)
  - :meth:`~eth.abc.BlockHeaderAPI`
