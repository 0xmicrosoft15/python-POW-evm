Fix for creating a duplicate "ghost" Computation that was never used. It didn't
break anything, but was ineligant and surprising to get extra objects created
that were mostly useless. This was achieved by changing
:meth:`ComputationAPI.apply_message` and
:meth:`ComputationAPI.apply_create_message` to be class methods.
