Switch Beam Sync from preferring low RTT to preferring high items per second (a patch to avoid peers
that return very quickly, but without most of the data you asked for).
Be more forgiving of slightly misbehaving peers during beam sync (for example, when they return no
nodes from GetNodeData request).
